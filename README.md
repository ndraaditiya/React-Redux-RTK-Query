# React-Redux-RTK-Query
A boilerplate Simple Todo App created with React Redux and RTK query
You can see the web on: **https://react-redux-rtk-queryy.vercel.app/**

But, in this project, my focus is on RTK Query not on the state slice or reducers, the reducers in this project just example how you put the reducer together with api made using RTK Query

In this project, at least You will know how to use RTK Query with CRUD endpoints, see the todoApi.jsx file

I get the API from this repo: https://github.com/ndraaditiya/public-api-crud-todoApp
